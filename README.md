Allowing Voters to choose any region for voting depending on their schedule. Hence,enabling everyone to cast their vote.

From the past records it is clear that not even 50% of the voters are coming to cast their votes;the reason being,either they are not in the area where their voter card is issued and where they can cast their votes or the have left the hope of better governance. We cant solve the later problem but if everyone is given the choice of state/area, it will not only be convenient for the voters but also would enable those who want but couldn't come because of thier jobs, college, duty during election like supervising boots.
The idea is to store the entire information of voters on the blockchain and instead of automatically alloting a center to  voters asking them to choose which area/locality/sate they want to select and alloting them the centers accordingly.
